Medieval Stone Keep
Lylek Games

Thank you for purchasing this asset!

This stone keep design kit contains 50 prefabs, including: walls, stairs, banners, rubble, etc., to construct medieval defenses.
Demo scene is provided.

Assets are built for quick-snap alignment, so you may drag and drop a series of walls to line up seamlessly while holding down
Ctrl (or Cmd). Tool handles must be in Pivot position (not Center).

Ready prefabs are included for each mesh.
Some pre-made tower prefabs are also included.

Hope you enjoy this package! Feel free to wright a review or leave a rating. =)

If you require any additional structures, run into any issues, or
have any questions or concerns, please contact:

I will be glad to help!
Thank you =)
